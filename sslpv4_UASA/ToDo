iMplementation of service reply for DA has to be implemented for multiple services

Service Reply Message Header has to be changed to reply with multiple services(Not required memory constrained environment)

If creating a function will take more memory or using an interface.(completed)

	Using Functions(same . If we use interfaces or not we get the same)

What happens if the scope is default for DA(Implemented)

What happens if the scope is default for SA(Implemented)

If DA is not available we should not renew the registration of the service for SA(Only sending the adverttisement to DA IF No DA is present then dont send it )

What will happen when after some time a DA is available. (He will directly unicast it to the DAs)

If the scope list is omitted,length of the scope list must be set to zero,and all services matching service type are discovered independent of scope list(completed)

What is the size of rpl(RAM:1kb,ROM:7kb)


What will happen when  service type is the same both they are present in different scope and user searches for default scope,so he should get the both services.(completed)

Check the retransmissions of the Service Request Message(completed)

If no service reply messages are present then send a signal to the user that no replies are found(completed)
